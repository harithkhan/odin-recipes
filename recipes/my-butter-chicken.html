    <div class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Malaysian butter chicken (奶油雞丁) aka buttermilk chicken is a dish that combines tender pieces of chicken with a rich and creamy sauce. 
            The chicken is typically marinated in a mixture of spices, often including garlic, ginger, and chili, before being cooked to perfection. 
            The creamy sauce is made with butter, evaporated milk, and sometimes additional ingredients like curry leaves, onions, and bell peppers. 
            The result is a dish with a luxurious texture and a balance of savory and slightly sweet flavors. Malaysian buttermilk chicken is often 
            served with rice or noodles and is a popular choice in Malaysian cuisine for its comforting and satisfying taste.</p>
