        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Skin-on salmon fillets</li>
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Dried parsley</li>
                <li>Dried minced onion</li>
                <li>Dried basil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Slice</strong> your salmon fillet into individual pieces before grilling. That will make it much easier to flip! 
                    I find that <strong>sharp kitchen shears</strong> work much better than a knife for cutting through the fish skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Preheat</strong> coals for an outdoor charcoal grill, gas grill, or indoor grill pan to medium heat. 
                    Cooking the salmon over medium heat (about 350°F-400°F) gives it that delicious, charred exterior while keeping the inside moist and tender.</li>
                <li><strong>Rub</strong> the flesh side of the salmon filets with olive oil, then sprinkle with the seasoning. 
                    This will prevent the fish from sticking to the grill, and it helps to create a crispy exterior.</li>
                <li><strong>Grill</strong> the salmon skin-side up for about 5 minutes, then flip it so that it’s skin side down to finish for about 5 more minutes. 
                    Flipping salmon while grilling ensures even cooking and helps prevent it from sticking to the grill. Keep a close eye on the salmon while it cooks. 
                    The total cooking time will vary depending on the size and thickness of your fillet and on the temperature of your grill. You’ll know that the 
                    fish is done when the flesh flakes easily with a fork. You don’t want to overcook it or the salmon will become dry.</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish</strong> each serving with fresh lemon wedges, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, or fresh herbs like fresh parsley and fresh basil, 
                    if desired.</li>
                 <li><strong>Pair</strong> the simple grilled salmon with just about any of your favorite sides, like a classic Caesar salad, no-knead bread, Charleston red rice, or 
                    skin on mashed red potatoes, and easy summer veggies like sauteed zucchini, roasted yellow squash, cucumber tomato onion salad, Southern-style green beans, 
                    succotash, and corn on the cob in the oven.</li>
            </ol>
